  Mechanical engineer focused on **hands-on prototyping, test engineering, and first‑principles design**. 
  I build, break, instrument, and iterate—then translate prototypes into production‑ready hardware and drawings.
  
  Recently: **CRAB Lab** robotic centipede autonomy & sensing; **GT Solar Racing** mechanical lead; and **composite materials testing**.
  
  **Why Anduril:** mission‑driven hardware, fast iteration, and real‑world impact. Strong fit for roles that
  require **design→test→production ownership**, **high‑quality CAD & drawings**, and **shop‑floor execution**.
  
  **Logistics:** U.S. person; Atlanta‑onsite; ready for full‑time 2026 start.  
  Interests: test engineering, robotics, reliability, field validation.

        title: Hardware, Test & First Principles
        description: |
          - Design→**prototype**→**analyze failures**→**productionize** workflows (DHF/ECN discipline).
          - **First‑principles** stress, stiffness, dynamics; verify with calcs, FEA, and bench tests.
          - **CAD & drawings** (GD&T; tolerances; materials; finish; stack‑ups; BOM ownership).
          - **Shop skills:** 3D printing, laser/waterjet, sheet metal, basic machining & assembly.
