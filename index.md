**Robotics MS student at ETH Zurich with interest in autonomy and making human-done processes safer, faster, and more efficient.**  
I am a MS in Robotics, Systems, and Controls at ETH, a world leader in robotics research and autonomy. 
Due to my previous experience
as a robotics intern and undergraduate degree from Georgia Tech, I have a keen interest in utliziing my experience in physical systems towards 
simulation, planning, and sensing. I hope to bring novel ideas and the most recent literature towards industries requiring rapid advancement 
such as agriculture, logistics, and defense. 


Recently: **Ground Control Robotics Intern** robotic simulation, sensing, and autonomy; **GT CRAB Lab** Student researcher, 1st author, experimentation. 

**Logistics:** U.S. Citizen; ready for full-time 2026 start.  
Interests: test engineering, robotics, reliability, field validation.

Assisted in creating a 5 segment MuJoCo robot model of a multilegged undulatory robot, including XML file definition, model tuning, and writing a python controller that implemented the current gait library from previous research. The purpose of the simulation is to test closed-loop control schemes and gait optimizations, ensuring a minimal sim to real gap through empirical validation.
