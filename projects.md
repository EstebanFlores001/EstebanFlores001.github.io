## Robotic Centipede — CRAB Lab (Georgia Tech)
> Undergraduate researcher in design, sensing, and autonomy for multi-legged, elongate robots

- Mechanical design & rapid prototyping of body/leg modules (additive, sheet metal, laser/waterjet).
- **Closed-loop control** on Raspberry Pi; IMU, encoder & camera integration; Python/C++ control stack.
- **Custom contact sensors** (capacitance/force) and a 6-axis arm test rig for drag-force studies.
- **Outcome:** reliable lab platforms + data pipelines for gait experiments and planning research.

## Mechanical Lead — Georgia Tech Solar Racing
> Mechanical lead for a road-worthy, multi-occupant solar vehicle to race across the U.S.

- **Frame, aero, steering, suspension** design & integration; 1000s-part SolidWorks assembly ownership.
- **First-principles + FEA** (ANSYS/NX) with physical test rigs to validate/repair suspension failures.
- **Composite chassis** design; DFM with in-house processes; drawing packs & vendor coordination.

## Composite Materials Characterization
> ASTM-based test program for in-house carbon sandwich panels and fiber layups

- Designed **compression, 4-pt bend, tension, joint** tests; standardized prep & fixturing.
- Processed thousands of data points in MATLAB; produced **datasheet-level properties** for design.
- Correlated **ANSYS Composite Pre/Post** with test results to set design factors of safety.
